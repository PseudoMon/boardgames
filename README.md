# Boardgames
An assortment of board games to be played on the terminal, made in Python 3. I made it for personal practice, and I prioritise readability over optimization.  

`baseboard.py` is a generic board game library that can be expanded into any kind of boardgame. At the moment there are

1. Checkers. `checkers.py` is the first iteration of the game, before the generic board game split. `checkersnoboard.py` is the current latest version.

2. Battleship, `battleship.py` is current in-progress.  

I ought to make some documentation for this eventually.
